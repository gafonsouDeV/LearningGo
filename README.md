# LearningGo
This repository will have documentation, code and projects of my path learning go golang. 

This is not a repository to learn how to program from scratch. To propperly understand the content of this repository you'll need to know the basics beforehand in any programming language. It will have a briefly definition of some basis but it's not enough to fully understand it, is just to refresh the memory.

Here will be also links from usefuls resources I used to study and learn.
