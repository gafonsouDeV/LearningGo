# LearningGo
This repository will have documentation, code and projects of my path learning go golang. 

This is not a repository to learn how to program from scratch. To propperly understand the content of this repository you'll need to know the basics beforehand in any programming language. It will have a briefly definition of some basis but it's not enough to fully understand it, is just to refresh the memory.

This repository will give you the main concepts and sintax of Go, anyway it will be needed a lot of practice, self-research to becoming confidence with this language.

Here will be also links from usefuls resources I used to study and learn.
